Thank you for providing the correct repository URL. I've successfully accessed the structure of the selling-partner-api-models repository.

Given the repository's structure and the concerns you've raised, here's the plan:

Retrieve OpenAPI Specifications: I'll identify and retrieve the content of the OpenAPI specification files from the repository. These files typically have a .json extension and are likely to be the ones you're concerned about.

Analyze Descriptions: I'll analyze the descriptions within each OpenAPI specification to check for duplicated or inaccurate descriptions.

Validate OpenAPI Specifications: I'll validate each specification against the OpenAPI 2.0 standard to ensure they conform.

Send Findings to Webhook: For each specification, I'll send the findings (both the description analysis and the validation results) to the provided webhook.

I'll start by retrieving the content of the OpenAPI specification files from the repository. Let's proceed.
